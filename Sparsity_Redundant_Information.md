In image classification task, when one sees an apple, he first attributes it as food, and then think of which food its is.
Subsequently, he observe it is one kind of fruit, and then find it is an apple. While one trained CNN will just compare its feature with all categories. 

Thus how to imitate the pattern of human learning without extensive annotations. I think weakly supervised learning and graph network make sense. clustering, unsupervised relation mining. Such classifying an image of one apple: we get its deep feature, but not compare it with all categories.
